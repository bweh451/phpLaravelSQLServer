## Discription:
This is a Laravel project, it's very bare bones and serves as a blog site for a fictional company. It integrates with SQL server in order to dynamically render blogs posts, catergory links and tag links.

## Installation:
In order to use this application you have to ensure that you have Composer installed. You can find an installation guide [here](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md). After following the installation guide and successfully installing composer, you will need to create a new Laravel project in the directory of your choice. You can then clone this repository within that directory. For more information on creating a new Laravel project and running said project you can have a look at Laravel's official docs [here](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation) underneath the `Your First Laravel Project` heading.

## Usage: 
After successfully installing an running laravel you can nivigate to `http://localhost:8000` within your browser to test out the webiste. The is also a search page available that enables you to search for a blog by their ID, category or tags.
